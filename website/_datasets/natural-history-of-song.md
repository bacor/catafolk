description: >
    "NHS Discography contains transcriptions and analyses of 118 field recordings from the 30 world regions covered in NHS Ethnography. [..] We selected recordings by reviewing published collections of world music, digitizing out-of-print recordings, and contacting anthropologists and ethnomusicologists to obtain unpublished field recordings. Each song was transcribed into music notation."

This page contains data and materials for the Natural History of Song project (Mehr et al., 2019, Science). The Data and Materials availability statement from the paper is copied below:

    All Natural History of Song data and materials are publicly archived at http://osf.io/jmv3q, with the exception of the full audio recordings in the NHS Discography, which are available via the Harvard Dataverse, at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SESAO1. All analysis scripts are available at http://github.com/themusiclab/nhs. Human Relations Area Files data and the eHRAF World Cultures database are available via licensing agreement at http://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu; the document- and paragraph-wise word histograms from the Probability Sample File were provided by the Human Relations Area Files under a Data Use Agreement. The Global Summary of the Year corpus is maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, United States Department of Commerce, and is publicly available at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/gsoy/.

Codebooks are available in Mehr et al. (2019). An online version of the codebook is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HabkzGBM2GFbP9LSBvF1NpDqYKs7yeHRsBmBdCfVx9Q/edit?usp=sharing

The 14-second excerpts of the NHS Discography songs that were analyzed in Mehr & Singh et al. (2018, Curr Bio) are available at https://osf.io/vcybz/. Citation information for all audio sources is in NHSDiscography_Metadata.csv.

The folders Datasets and Transcriptions contain NHS-specific raw data. For convenience, we also included zip versions of both. Transcriptions_all.zip also includes draft transcriptions as well as other file formats for the transcriptions, including musicXML and ngram files.
