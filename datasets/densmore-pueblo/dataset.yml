    description: >
      The following fields are currently ignored: `LING_GROUP` (the language family, it seems)
      `LANG` (mostly value `'Tone'`, probably indicating it is a tone language). `REG` (we use
      the location information from `additional-metadata.csv`), and `SUPERFUNCTION` (the genre
      or `'tribename'`)
