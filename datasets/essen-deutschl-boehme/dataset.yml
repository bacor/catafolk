issues:
  - title: Wrong titles
    description: >
      The titles do not correspond to the titles used by Böhme.
      Instead, they are textual incipits as you can see on 
      [this online scan](https://archive.org/details/BoehmeVtLieder1895).
  - title: Missing page numbers
    description: >
      There are no page numbers in the source files. We do have song numbers,
      which can be derived from the catalogue numbers. 
  - title: Bibliographic references in comments?
    description: >
      There are some pointers to the sources in the comments,
      that is, not as a reference record, but after `!!`;
      usually below `!!!AGN:`. Can we extract these?
