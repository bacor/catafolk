issues:
  - title: Missing page numbers
    description: >
      There are no page numbers in the source files. We do have song numbers,
      which can be derived from the catalogue numbers.
  - title: Cannot find scans
    description: >
      I can't find any scans of the book to verify the song numbering...
  - title: Ignoring useful comments
    description: >
      We now ignore useful comments besides the metadata. For example, in `deut3790`,
      we find the comment "Neuere Melodie, noch 1850 am Niederrhein gehoert."
