Catafolk notes
--------------

- Densmore reports the songs were collected in Keshena, Neopit and Zoar, all of which lie \
Menominee County, Wisconsin. All songs are assigned that location.


Notes on additional metadata
----------------------------

Additional metadata can be found in this
[Google Docs sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWUdnKA8xeRsh2tUteiYDEqjwVY5S6LOlyLwRVaq7lA)

- If there was no indication of the use of a drum (e.g. a drum tempo, or a drum trancription),
    the song is assumed to be monophonic.
- In some songs, the drums play in a different tempo than the melody. These have a `bpm` 
value `'mixed'`. (Note that both values can be found in the additional metadata, but they
are not used in catafolk).
