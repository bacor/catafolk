This was done, and the transcription is from his second recording of the song. On comparing the two performances, it was found that the first did not contain the third period. This, together with the intricate rhythm of the song, is an evidence of musical ability on the part of the singer. An entire change of rhythm occurs in the second period which is made emphatic by an accent on a sixteenth note. Four rhythmic units are shown in the transcription.
