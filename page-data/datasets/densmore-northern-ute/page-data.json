Other songs containing the same characteristics are Nos. 3, 4, 6, 10, 15, and 16 in the Bear dance songs, and a majority of the hand game songs, Nos. 94-102. This rhythmic and melodic peculiarity suggests a vocal expression scarcely developed to the point of composed song. We find in it a resem blance to the rhythmic vocalization which accompanies concerted labor among peoples low in the scale of culture. In a majority of the songs cited the principal interval is the minor (or nonmajor) third, which characterizes the most primitive vocal expression of uncivilized peoples. (See Bull. 53, p. 7.) This interval is prominent also in the early music of civilization. The tone material of this song comprises a fundamental (G), with its minor third and minor seventh—a tone material not previously noted by the writer. For convenience the song is analyzed as in the key of G minor, though it can scarcely be said to constitute a key in the accepted sense of that term.\r\nThe rhythm of the notched-stick rattle is simple and does not vary in the songs recorded with its accompaniment. The rubbing stick is thrust downward upon the notched stick, producing a sharp, rasping sound, and as it is brought upward, preparatory to the next stroke, there is a similar but less pronounced sound, the downward stroke occupying a period of time slightly longer than that required for returning the rubbing stick to its original position. The sound pro duced by the upward motion varied with individuals, those who used he rattle with special energy producing, of course, a louder sound with the upward motion of the rubbing stick. The song under analysis is the only recorded Bear dance song in which the rattle and voice are not synchronous at the beginning of each count. In this song the tempo of the rattle is slightly slower than that of the voice.","lyrics":null,"lyrics_translation":null},{"id":"ute003","title":"Dance Faster","title_translation":null,"location":"Whiterocks","latitude":40.4675,"longitude":-109.929722,"auto_geocoded":false,"language":"Ute","glottolog_id":"utee1244","culture":"Ute","culture_dplace_id":null,"culture_hraf_id":"NT19","genres":["dance","animal"],"performer":["Fred Mart"],"performer_genders":["male"],"instrumentation":["voice","morache"],"instrument_use":true,"percussion_use":true,"voice_use":true,"key":"C major","modality":null,"ambitus":null,"tempo":["104"],"meters":["2/4","3/4"],"metric_classification":null,"collector":["Frances Densmore"],"collection_date":null,"collection_date_earliest":"1914","collection_date_latest":null,"source_key":"densmore1922ute","publication_type":"book","publication_title":null,"publication_authors":["Frances Densmore"],"publication_date":"1922","source_page_num":61,"source_song_num":"3","tune_family_id":null,"catalogue_num":"772","source_url":"https://books.google.nl/books?id=fEhAAAAAYAAJ&hl=nl&pg=PA61","encoder":["Daniel Shanahan","Eva Shanahan"],"encoding_date":"2014","contributors":[],"copyright":"Copyright 2014 Daniel and Eva Shanahan","license_id":null,"path":"data/No_3_Dance_Faster.krn","file_format":"kern","version":null,"checksum":"df3cd605e07e67e7dff94702e190c1dd","url":"https://github.com/shanahdt/densmore/blob/master/Densmore/northern_ute/No_3_Dance_Faster.krn","preview_url":null,"has_lyrics":false,"has_music":true,"file_has_licence":null,"other_fields":"{\"lang\": \"Non-Tone\", \"ling_group\": \"Uto-Aztecan\", \"social_function\": \"songs of the bear dance\", \"genre\": \"bear dance\"}","comments":["Lyrics are partially transcribed in the publication"],"warnings":null,"description":"This song, in contrast to that next preceding, is char acterized by the interval of the major third, which constitutes 52 per cent of the intervals.

It will be noted that in the first form the tonic triad appears as the lower and in the second form as the upper portion of the chord. The second is the more frequent form, as shown by the fact that 11 Chippewa songs are characterized by this chord and only three are minor in tonality. (See song No. 30.) In the song under analysis the tonic triad (G sharp, B-D sharp) forms the framework of the melody, the seventh being less prominent and occurring only twice. The rhythmic unit is short and its repe titions comprise all the song except the closing measures.

(Cf. Nos. 39 and 78.) Six renditions were recorded in 1914, the renditions being uniform and connected without a break in the time. The transcrip tion is from the cylinder made in 1914. Five renditions of the same song were recorded in 1916, at which time the writer did not play, the first record, but \"hummed\" the transcription. The singer recog nized it and said he would like to make another record of it. This second cylinder was transcribed and the results compared. In this comparison it is found that all the renditions recorded in 1916 omit the fifth and sixth measures and the last measure of the song as transcribed. As these measures are repetitions, this would be of slight importance, but as it reduces the occurrences of these phrases from three to two the change suggests a tendency toward regularity and conventionality. The first group of renditions was in a tempo of quarter = 104, and the key of G minor: the second was faster (quarter =108) but in a lower key—the key of F sharp minor. The 5-4 division of certain measures was strictly maintained. The song contains the tones of the second five-toned scale and is melodic in structure. Considering the lack of variety in progressions the melody is inter esting and quite diversified. One-half the intervals are minor thirds, and of the other half all except one interval are major seconds, that interval being an ascending fourth.

Nos. 39 and 77). The repetition arose from an impression frequently noted among the Indians, that if the words are changed in a melody it becomes a different song. Thus, in the first instance, the singer said this was a song which he sang in the war dance when he brought home a captive woman, and, in the second instance, he said it was a scalp dance song. The words were not taken in either rendition.\r\nA comparison of the two cylinders shows the pitch of the rendi tions to be the same. Five repetitions of the song were recorded the first time and six the second time. The differences in these 11 renditions are too slight to be of importance. In the first group the opening phrase was occasionally repeated, and in the second group the ending was occasionally changed in rhythm, and the fifth measure (last two counts) contained quarter in place of eighth notes. Passing from this comparison to an analysis of the transcription, we note that the melody contains only the tones of the minor triad and fourth and in structure is melodic with harmonic framework.

The fifth measure contains in its second count a division resembling that of the rhythmic unit but which was uniformly sung as two sixteenths instead of an eighth note. The only progressions are fourths and major seconds. In ascending progression there are seven fourths and three whole tones, and in descending progression there are eight fourths and three whole tones. Considering A to be the keynote of the melody, its tones are the key note, fourth, and fifth.

(n.d.). The Densmore collection of Native American songs: A new corpus for studies of effects of geograpy, language and social function on folk song. 3.\n\n\n\nNotes on additional metadata\n----------------------------\n\nAdditional metadata was collected from the original publication (Densmore 1922) by Bas Cornelissen in 2020. It is stored as a separate [CSV file](https://github.com/bacor/catafolk/blob/master/datasets/densmore-northern-ute/additional-metadata.csv), see also this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E9DcV8ajtnhnVkehvjamAsgl4Y9784f2YWo39Y9MWRM)\n\n- The table with the names of the singers (p. 19) lists a singer (no 10) of\nwhich there are no songs included in the book. The native name of singer 12\nthen refers to singer 10, so I've used that native name for singer 12. Not\nquite sure if that's correct. On the next page, Densmore notes that 'Perank' is \na mispronunciation of 'Frank'.","wordCount":{"words":154}}},"sources":{"nodes":[{"content":"@book{boehme1877altdeutsches,\n  title={Altdeutsches Liederbuch: Volkslieder der Deutschen nach Wort und Weise aus dem 12. bis zum 17.
