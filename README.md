Catafolk
========

*A catalogue of folk music datasets for computational ethnomusicology*

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/catafolk/badge/?version=latest)](https://catafolk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Catafolk automatically indexes and analyzes folk music datasets and collects all metadata in standardized, easy to use csv files.
These CSV files are also used to generate the [Catafolk website](https://bacor.github.io/catafolk): a user interface for those files. 

**Note: the project is still in an early stage.**
